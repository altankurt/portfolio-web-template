                During the web design process, I strive to design a website that
                meets the needs of users.

                <img
                  class="flex"
                  src="/public/assets/icons/plus.svg"

                  alt="faq-mobile-images"
                />
                Factors such as fast website loading, ease of navigation, and
                mobile compatibility help users stay on the website longer and
                increase the value of the brand. <br />
                In web design, I also strive to stand out from my competitors.
                Original and eye-catching designs differentiate our brand by
                attracting the attention of target audiences. Additionally, the
                website's easily memorable domain name, logo, and colors are
                important in establishing our brand identity.

                In addition to design, I also prioritize usability and user
                experience. It is important for users to navigate the website

                perform their tasks. <br />

                having a user-friendly website with an aesthetically pleasing

                I also use the latest technologies. I use responsive design for
                the application to be compatible with different devices,
                optimization for the application to work quickly, and advanced
                technologies to develop in-app features. <br />
                During the mobile application development process, I also value
                user feedback. Our users' thoughts and suggestions about the
                application guide us in the development process and help us
                create a user-focused application.

                User research involves using methods such as user interviews,
                observations, and surveys to determine users' needs. Through
                these methods, important information can be obtained such as
                what users expect from our products and services, which problems
                they want to solve, and what they are satisfied with.
                <br />
                User research also helps us understand if our products and
                services are suitable for our target audience. By developing
                designs and features that meet users' needs, we can increase
                user satisfaction and differentiate ourselves from our
                competitors.
